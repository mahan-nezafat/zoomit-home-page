# zoomit-home-page
zoomit.ir responsive home  page with HTML,CSS,JS

# description 

in this project I used reponsive design with media queries of css and with the help of Javascript made the project more dynamic.

some of my challenges were:

* what responsive means and how do I make a webpage for different screen sizes?
* how to make a dropdown menu that has multiple dropdowns and when the page is scrolling it will be fixed top of the page and how to create a hamburger menu dropdown?
* when I have multiple side bars how do I scroll up or down on the page and having the side bars scrolling in a specific position and height relative to the page?
* how do I create a scroll to top button?

with the knowledge that I had from [sheypoor-landing-page](https://github.com/mahan-nezafat/sheypoor-landing-page) and deepening my other skills in programming 
I was able to overcome these challenges.

as of today the design of zoomit website has changed and this project of mine is from design of the older version of the site.
